# PathFinder

This program was created to stop having to constantly check transit times, and predeterminingly send them to your phone.
It uses the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) to send the data. Which means you need to set up the API keys for both from the Tokens.cs file.

You can customize where you would like to travel and preferred methods of transit through the program.
In this example I have it to set up times to travel to the gym, including exercise times and when to leave to catch the train back.
